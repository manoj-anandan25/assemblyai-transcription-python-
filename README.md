itfhhrjfhfhehdhdhjdhdhhfhhdhg
This project demonstrates how to:
1. Upload an audio file to [AssemblyAI](https://www.assemblyai.com/)  
2. Transcribe it into text  
3. (Optional) Generate a quick summary of the transcription  

The script uses the **AssemblyAI API** with Python’s `requests` library.
